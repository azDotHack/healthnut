Fitness quotient: poor, below average, average, above average, excellent (determines initial intensity)
age:5-17, 18-64, 65+ (determines number of tasks given)
BMI: underweight(<18), healthy(18-24), overweight(25-29), obese(30-39), extremely obese(40+) (determines scaling)


BMI = Weight (lb) / (Height (in))^2 x 703

FQ = 1-5
BMI = 1-5
age= 1-3

Types
-Aerobic (running, swimming, dancing, biking, stair runs)
-Strength (weights, machines, resistance bands)
-Flexibility (yoga, stretching)
-Balance (heel-to-toe walking, standing on one foot, tai chi)

Goals (weight exercise types):
- Lose weight (70,5,15,10)
- gain muscle (15,60,10,15)
- endurance (60,10,10,20)
- flexible (25,15,50,10)

Scaling
- every week that the user completes at least 70% of tasks, increase intensity by (5,10,8,5,3)% based on BMI
- if the user completes between 30 and 70% of tasks, keep intensity the same
- if the user completes less than 30% of tasks, reduce intensity by % based on BMI
